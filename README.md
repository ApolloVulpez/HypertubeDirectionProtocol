# Introduction

HypertubeDirectionalProtocol is a low resource mod that does one simple thing. 
It allows the player to use A and D to decide which direction they travel down a Hypertube Junction/Branch! 

## Reasoning

When I first added a junction on my hypertube I thought it was awesome, that I didn't have to have multiple tubes going to multiple places. All in one pipe I could reach multiple places.. but.. I use hypertube cannons alot! And sometimes I moved so fast, I didn't have time to react to press E and make sure I was going the right way. 

This mod solves that! 

## Basic Idea

When you're coming up to a hyper tube junction, or hypertube branch. Just hold the direction you want to travel before you reach the junction/branch. You'll then travel that direction without issues! Simple!
## Functionality
Any hypertube junction in all directions
Any hypertube branches
Works on Hyperjunctions place on walls and ceilings

## Future Plans
Remove the old Cycle Travel Direction dialogue and add my own that states the keys
